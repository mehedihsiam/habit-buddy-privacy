# Privacy Policy for Habit Buddy

This Privacy Policy describes how Habit Buddy ("the App") collects, uses, and shares your information.

## 1. Data Collection and Use

Habit Buddy is designed to help you track your personal habits. The App operates primarily offline and stores all your habit data (habit names, check-ins, and related timestamps) **locally on your device**.

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal identifying information (PII) from your use of the App.** Your habit data remains exclusively on your device.

## 2. Information We Do Not Collect

Habit Buddy does not collect:
*   Your name, email address, or any other contact information.
*   Location data.
*   Usage data for analytics or advertising purposes that is tied to your identity.
*   Any data from your device without your explicit permission.

## 3. Third-Party Services

The App may use third-party libraries or services that may collect information. These third-party service providers have their own privacy policies regarding how they use such information. Examples include:
*   **React Native:** The framework itself.
*   **React Native Paper:** UI component library.
*   **@react-native-async-storage/async-storage:** Used for local data storage on your device.
*   **@react-navigation/native:** Navigation library.
*   **react-native-calendars:** Calendar component.
*   **react-native-chart-kit:** Charting library for visualizations.
*   **react-native-safe-area-context:** Handles safe area insets.
*   **react-native-screens:** Provides native primitives for navigation.
*   **react-native-uuid:** Used for generating unique IDs locally.
*   **react-native-vector-icons:** Provides icons.
*   **Other standard React Native dependencies:** Basic system components.

To the best of our knowledge, these libraries, as used in Habit Buddy, do not independently collect PII or habit data that is then transmitted externally by the App itself.

## 4. Security

We value your trust in providing us your habits, thus we strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. However, remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
